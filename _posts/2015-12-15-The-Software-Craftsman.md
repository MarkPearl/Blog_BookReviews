There have been a few books in my professional career that have had a major impact on my work and the way I see this world. They include [Clean Code](http://bookreviews.markpearl.co.za/Clean-Code/), [The Pragmatic Programmer](http://bookreviews.markpearl.co.za/The-Pragmatic-Programmer/) and a few others. I'm pleased to add "The Software Craftsman" to that category.

I've heard the word Software Craftsman thrown around for a couple of years. It's not what I would call a neutral term - I've seen some coments made about Software Craftmanship by some very knowledgable people that say it is not a good thing - that the title is for the exclusive few who feel they know better than everyone else - that many of the people that claim the title have lost touch with the real world and shipping to production. 

I then have to reconcile these views with my own experiences. I've worked with many software developers over the years - some good, some really bad. Some of the best developers I have worked with have humbly taken on the title of software craftsman.

Which leads me to why I found so much value in this book. It helped solidify my understanding of what the word actually means - in essence to become a professional developer and have pride in your work.

What I loved most about the book was the journey it took me on. The author, Sandro Mancuso, shared several experiences I could relate to directly, which validated my own experiences.
