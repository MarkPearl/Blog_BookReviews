Great reference book.

I recently did an introductory 'Artificial Intelligence' course at University and this book proved to be worth the spend. It covers a range of algorithms - from sorting algorithms all the way to path finding algorithms and everything in between. It was way better than the books prescribed for the course by that particular University. I liked its hands on approach, the explanations for each algorithm are concise with practical examples. This is a great reference book, one worth owning.
