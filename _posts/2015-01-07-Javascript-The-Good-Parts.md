I was initially surprised about how thin this book is, but then again, it is JavaScript ;-)

This is a must read book if you are serious about web development. It made me realize how special a beast JavaScript is and how to play nicely. Each section was well thought out. The chapters at the end which include the bad parts and the worse parts were also really useful.

I'm going to be reading this book several times. You need to do the same.
