Managing Humans is the upgrade to ["Behind Closed Doors"](http://bookreviews.markpearl.co.za/Behind-Closed-Doors). It has some brilliant perspectives and concepts that I think would be relevant to anyone involved in the management aspects of software development. While I feel on the whole the book is brilliant, it also has a few rough edges that felt like they were a bad fit. In particular, I struggled to get value from two sections "A Nerd in a Cave" and "NADD" which were probably better off being left out. With that said, it is a wealth of knowledge written in an easy to congest format. This type of book you read once cover to cover, and then periodically come back to as a reference manual every few months.

Sections & concepts that stood out to me:

Don't Be a Prick : The underlying rule for all managers.  

#### How to run a meeting ####

- Creation vs Alignment Meetings  
- Meetings have 2 critical components: Agenda & Referee  
- A meetings progress is measure by flow , referee's job is to keep a meeting flowing  
- Rule for everyone in a meeting is if your attention is elsewhere, you aren't listening  

Creation Meetings:  
- diving into solving a hard problem  
- getting people to agree on a way forward  

A referee should be aware of the following:  
- Pull people back if they don't look engaged  
- If several people looked checked out, get them checked in
- Change scenery to get things going 

#### Disecting the Mandate ####

- Know what your role is and if you actually have a mandate  
- Two types of mandates: local & foreign  
- Decide when to employ the mandate, be careful to not leverage the mandate unless you absolutely have to  
- Decide, Deliver, Deliver Again: When you deliver a mandate, don't assume it is going to be enacted on, deliver and deliver again. 
- 3 outcomes from a mandate: Yay, Yawn or Boo  
- Always make sure you have solid justification and reasoning when delivering a mandate, the fact you have to pull the card is an indicator is will be challenged  

#### Subtlety, Subterfuge & Silence ####

Management is like chess. When you're presented with a problem, you sometimes need to sit back and take a look at the board, figure out the consequences of each move, and most importantly pick a move.

3 types of moves you should be aware of: Subtlety, Subterfuge & Silence  

Subtlety starts with humility. Exhibiting your power and knowledge as a manager isn't always the best method of communicating. Sometimes your approach needs to start small, humble, and in a place where you admit you don't have all the answers. 

Subterfuge is a risk, You break trust with subterfuge. Sometimes it may be necessary, but be careful.  

Silence. Sometimes it is best to be quiet and listen. When you are not sure where people are going with an idea or a chat, be quiet and listen.
