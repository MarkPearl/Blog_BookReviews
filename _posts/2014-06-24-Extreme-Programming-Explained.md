I have read a lot of software development books, but there remain a handful that had such a major impact on my life that they fundamentally made me look at software development differently. 

[Clean Code](http://bookreviews.markpearl.co.za/programming/2011/05/23/Clean-Code/) and the [Pragmatic Programmer](http://bookreviews.markpearl.co.za/programmer/2011/03/11/The-Pragmatic-Programmer/) are two that are at the top of my list. Today I have to add Kent Beck's Extreme Programming Explained 2nd Edition to that elite group.

The physical book looks deceptively thin - one hundred and sixty odd pages with an easy text, but between those pages is a message worth gold.

Kent Beck's explanation of the relationship between Values, Principles and Practices is as far as I am concerned a required reading for software developers going forward. I have seen teams struggle, debate and argue about various practices and whether they are good or bad - for the first time in my life I can justify one practice over another, one tool over another and explain and choose fundamentally why one is better than another.

The rest of the book continues to contain these gems
