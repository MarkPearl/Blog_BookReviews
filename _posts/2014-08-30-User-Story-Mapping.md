I've been involved in agile development for a few years but was only recently introduced to the process of story mapping - after reading Jeff Patton’s book I’m feeling more and more like story mapping has been a big missing link.

For instance, one of the common challenges I have faced in the past is deciding on how to get thin vertical slices of releasable features that add value. We used user stories in the past - but looking back at the process we always battled to see the whole picture and often didn’t reach our intended goal.

I believe the process of story mapping fills this gap - this is the most effective approach I have seen to getting really good thin vertical slices of real value in a usable and pragmatic way.
